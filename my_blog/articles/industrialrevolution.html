	    		</h1>
	    		<h4 class="text-left">By: Laurent Martin

	    		<p>There are many details about this time period but when looking at the “forest” and not at a specific tree you see how one element of British life, or a “tree”, helped the whole forest, or “British Society.”
	    		</p>
	    		<p><img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" src="images/kinggeorge.jpg" alt="King George the 3rd" title="King George the 3rd">One such of these helpful trees came in the form of government. Monarchies are still in power and most still hold a tight grip on all things in their Kingdoms. However the British Monarchy, under the rule of King George the 3rd, in 1760 would loosen their grip on governance and allow an elected government of sorts to administer the rule of law. This dispersion of power allowed men, who were more sympathetic and wise to scientific progress than religious, to encourage scientists to collaborate openly with merchants to make their products commercial.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>Of course in 1700’s Europe you also have the Vatican and their repressive inquisitions. But remember thanks to King Henry the 8th, England and now Britain ceded from Roman Catholicism and created the Church England.
	    		</p>
	    		<p>So with encouragement from government and no interference from the church, British industrialist went out looking to improve. The first things they industrialize was agriculture. Up until the 1700’s nothing had changed when it came to farming techniques and the tool. You grew one type of crop in the spring and summer, harvest in the fall, and shut down operations and brace for winter.
